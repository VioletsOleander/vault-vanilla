## About this book
Before PowerShell, I began my career as an IT Pro, pointing and clicking in the GUI. I wrote this book to save IT Pros from themselves by reducing the learning curve and helping them avoid being reluctant to learn PowerShell.

Instead of a book that covers topics with fictitious scenarios, this book is a condensed version targeting the specific topics that an IT Pro needs to know to succeed with PowerShell in a real-world production environment. It's a collection of what I wish someone had told me when I started learning PowerShell. I include tips, tricks, and best practices that I learned while using PowerShell since 2007.

Each chapter includes a curated collection of links to specific help articles that expand on the information covered. These resources expand on the concepts discussed and broaden your understanding of PowerShell.

## Who is this book for?
This book is for anyone wanting to learn PowerShell. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, this book helps you improve your PowerShell skills.

This book focuses on Windows PowerShell version 5.1 running on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 in a Microsoft Active Directory domain environment. However, the basic concepts apply to all versions of PowerShell running on any supported platform.

## Lab environment
The examples in this book were created and tested on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 operating systems, using Windows PowerShell version 5.1. If you're running a different operating system or version of PowerShell, your results might vary from the ones presented in this book.
