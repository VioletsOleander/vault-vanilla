The `conda` command is the primary interface for managing installations of various packages. It can:

- Query and search the Anaconda package index and current Anaconda installation.
- Create new conda environments.
- Install and update packages into existing conda environments.

Tip
You can abbreviate many frequently used command options that are preceded by 2 dashes (`--`) to just 1 dash and the first letter of the option. So `--name` and `--envs` can be written as `-n` and `-e` respectively.

For full usage of each command, including abbreviations, see [commands](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/commands/index.html). You can see the same information at the command line by [viewing the command-line help](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/tasks/view-command-line-help.html).
