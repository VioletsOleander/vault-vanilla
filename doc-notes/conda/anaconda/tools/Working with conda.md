# Overview
Installing Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda gives you access to conda, Python, and thousands of other popular packages. Anaconda Distribution installs more than 300 of these packages automatically, while Miniconda is a more lightweight distribution that contains only conda, python, their dependencies, and a small number of other packages.

**Which installer is right for you?** See [Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started#should-i-use-anaconda-distribution-or-miniconda)

This section of the documentation covers instructions that work with either Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda installations, but if you need documentation specific to one installation or the other, click below:

## What is conda?
Conda is a free, open-source software program for package and environment management originally developed by Anaconda. Today, conda is maintained by members of the open source community and operates independently from Anaconda, Inc. Anyone can contribute to conda, [including you](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/working-with-conda/reference/contribute)!
>  `conda` 最初由 Anaconda 开发，如今由社区维护，独立于 Anaconda 运作

Anaconda’s conda documentation is focused on using conda with Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda. Our documentation includes links to relevant resources in the official conda docs at [docs.conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) which provide detailed information about conda commands and technical guides for using conda.

While conda is free to use, use of Anaconda Distribution and Anaconda’s [default channels](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/working-with-conda/reference/default-channels) are subject to Anaconda’s Terms of Service and may require a license. For details on Anaconda’s Terms of Service, see our [Terms of Service FAQ](https://www.anaconda.com/pricing/terms-of-service-faqs) and our official [Terms of Service](https://legal.anaconda.com/policies/en/).
