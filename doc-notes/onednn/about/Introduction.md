# oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) Developer Guide and Reference
oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source cross-platform performance library of basic building blocks for deep learning applications.
>  oneAPI 深度神经网络库 (oneDNN) 是一个开源的跨平台性能库，提供深度学习应用的基本构建模块

The library is optimized for Intel(R) Architecture Processors, Intel Graphics, and Arm(R) 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)-based processors. oneDNN has experimental support for the following architectures: NVIDIA* GPU, AMD* GPU, OpenPOWER* Power ISA (PPC64), IBMz* (s390x), and RISC-V.
>  oneDNN 库针对 Intel 架构处理器、Intel 图形处理器、ARM 64 位架构进行了优化
>  oneDNN 针对以下架构提供了试验性支持:
>  - NVIDIA GPU
>  - AMD GPU
>  - OpenPOWER Power ISA
>  - IBMz
>  - RISC-V

oneDNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework developers interested in improving application performance on CPUs and GPUs.
