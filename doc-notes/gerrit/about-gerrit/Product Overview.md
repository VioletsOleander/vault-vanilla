# Gerrit Code Review Product Overview
>  version v3.11.2

Gerrit Code Review is a web-based code review tool built on [Git version control](https://git-scm.com/).

## What is Gerrit Code Review?
Gerrit provides a framework you and your teams can use to review code before it becomes part of the code base. Gerrit works equally well in open source projects that limit the number of users who can approve changes (typical in open source software development) and in projects in which all contributors are trusted.

## What is Code Review?
Code reviews can identify mistakes before they’re found by customers. In a world of continuous integration, code must be tested before it’s submitted to the master branch to become part of the code base. Tests confirm that a product works (and continues to work) as intended by the developers.
>  在持续集成的过程中，代码必须在被提交到主分支之前被测试
>  测试需要确认产品在更新后可以按开发者的预期正常工作 (并且持续正常工作)

When code is reviewed, developers:

1. Work carefully and consistently
2. Learn best practices and new techniques from other developers
3. Implement consistency and quality across the code base

Code reviews typically turn up issues related to:

1. Design: Is code well-designed and suited to the code base?
2. Functionality: Does code perform as intended and in a way that is good for users?
3. Complexity: Can other developers understand and use the code?
4. Naming: Does the code contain clear names for elements such as variables, classes, and methods?
5. Comments: Are comments specific and complete?
