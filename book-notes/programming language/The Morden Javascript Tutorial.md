# Part 1 The Javascript Language
# 1 An Introduction
## 1.1 An Introduction to JavaScript
Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and what other technologies play well with it.

### What is JavaScript?
*JavaScript* was initially created to "make web pages alive".

The programs in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
> JS 程序称为 scripts
> scripts 可以写在 HTML 中（纯文本），在网页加载时自动运行

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run.

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called [Java](https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).

Why is it called JavaScript?
When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called [ECMAScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), and now it has no relation to Java at all.
>JS 有自己的规范 ECMAScript

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine).
> JS 的执行环境称为 JS engine

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
> 浏览器内嵌 JS 引擎，称为 JS 虚拟机

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

- [V8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)) – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
- [SpiderMonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey) – in Firefox.
- …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.

The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.

How do engines work?
Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.

1. The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
2. Then it converts (“compiles”) the script to machine code.
3. And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.

The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.
> 引擎本质上就是 JS 的编译器

### What can in-browser JavaScript do?
Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
> JS 不提供对内存和 CPU 的访问

JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, [Node.js](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.
> JS 的能力依赖于运行环境

In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.
> 浏览器内 JS 处理与 web 相关事务

For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:

- Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
- React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) and [COMET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) technologies).
- Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
- Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).

### What CAN'T in-browser JavaScript do?
JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited to protect the user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing private information or harming the user’s data.

Examples of such restrictions include:

- JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS functions.
    不访问 OS 函数，因此不能随意读写磁盘文件
    
    Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only provided if the user does certain actions, like “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting it via an `<input>` tag.
    
    There are ways to interact with the camera/microphone and other devices, but they require a user’s explicit permission. So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera, observe the surroundings and send the information to the [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency).
    
- Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other. Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from one page may not access the other page if they come from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).
    不同网页之间的 JS 一般不通信
     
    This is called the “Same Origin Policy”. To work around that, _both pages_ must agree for data exchange and must contain special JavaScript code that handles it. We’ll cover that in the tutorial.
    
    This limitation is, again, for the user’s safety. A page from `http://anysite.com` which a user has opened must not be able to access another browser tab with the URL `http://gmail.com`, for example, and steal information from there.
    
- JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
    JS 可以和当前 page 来源的服务器通信，但从其他服务器接受数据的能力受限 

Such limitations do not exist if JavaScript is used outside of the browser, for example on a server. Modern browsers also allow plugins/extensions which may ask for extended permissions.
> 运行于浏览器环境外的 JS 没有这类限制

### What makes JavaScript unique?
There are at least _three_ great things about JavaScript:

- Full integration with HTML/CSS.
- Simple things are done simply.
- Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.

JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.

That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.

That said, JavaScript can be used to create servers, mobile applications, etc.

### Languages "over" JavaScript
The syntax of JavaScript does not suit everyone’s needs. Different people want different features.

That’s to be expected, because projects and requirements are different for everyone.

So, recently a plethora of new languages appeared, which are _transpiled_ (converted) to JavaScript before they run in the browser.
> JS 之上的语言在运行于浏览器之前会转译为 JS

Modern tools make the transpilation very fast and transparent, actually allowing developers to code in another language and auto-converting it “under the hood”.

Examples of such languages:

- [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) is “syntactic sugar” for JavaScript. It introduces shorter syntax, allowing us to write clearer and more precise code. Usually, Ruby devs like it.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is concentrated on adding “strict data typing” to simplify the development and support of complex systems. It is developed by Microsoft.
- [Flow](https://flow.org/) also adds data typing, but in a different way. Developed by Facebook.
- [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) is a standalone language that has its own engine that runs in non-browser environments (like mobile apps), but also can be transpiled to JavaScript. Developed by Google.
- [Brython](https://brython.info/) is a Python transpiler to JavaScript that enables the writing of applications in pure Python without JavaScript.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html) is a modern, concise and safe programming language that can target the browser or Node.

There are more. Of course, even if we use one of these transpiled languages, we should also know JavaScript to really understand what we’re doing.

### Summary

- JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.
- Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.
- There are many languages that get “transpiled” to JavaScript and provide certain features. It is recommended to take a look at them, at least briefly, after mastering JavaScript.

## 1.2 Manuals and specifications
This book is a _tutorial_. It aims to help you gradually learn the language. But once you’re familiar with the basics, you’ll need other resources.

### Specification
[The ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.
> ECMA-262 定义 JS 语言

But being that formalized, it’s difficult to understand at first. So if you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place. But it’s not for everyday use.

A new specification version is released every year. Between these releases, the latest specification draft is at [https://tc39.es/ecma262/](https://tc39.es/ecma262/).
> 标准每年一更新

To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are “almost standard” (so-called “stage 3”), see proposals at [https://github.com/tc39/proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals).

Also, if you’re developing for the browser, then there are other specifications covered in the [second part](https://javascript.info/browser-environment) of the tutorial.

### Manuals

- **MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference** is the main manual with examples and other information. It’s great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.
    
    You can find it at [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference).
    

Although, it’s often best to use an internet search instead. Just use “MDN [term]” in the query, e.g. [https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt](https://google.com/search?q=MDN+parseInt) to search for the `parseInt` function.

### Compatibility tables
JavaScript is a developing language, new features get added regularly.

To see their support among browser-based and other engines, see:

- [https://caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/) – per-feature tables of support, e.g. to see which engines support modern cryptography functions: [https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography](https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography).
- [https://kangax.github.io/compat-table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table) – a table with language features and engines that support those or don’t support.

All these resources are useful in real-life development, as they contain valuable information about language details, their support, etc.

Please remember them (or this page) for the cases when you need in-depth information about a particular feature.

## 1.3 Code editors
A code editor is the place where programmers spend most of their time.

There are two main types of code editors: IDEs and lightweight editors. Many people use one tool of each type.

### IDE
The term [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (Integrated Development Environment) refers to a powerful editor with many features that usually operates on a “whole project.” As the name suggests, it’s not just an editor, but a full-scale “development environment.”

An IDE loads the project (which can be many files), allows navigation between files, provides autocompletion based on the whole project (not just the open file), and integrates with a version management system (like [git](https://git-scm.com/)), a testing environment, and other “project-level” stuff.

If you haven’t selected an IDE yet, consider the following options:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (cross-platform, free).
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (cross-platform, paid).

For Windows, there’s also “Visual Studio”, not to be confused with “Visual Studio Code”. “Visual Studio” is a paid and mighty Windows-only editor, well-suited for the .NET platform. It’s also good at JavaScript. There’s also a free version [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/).

Many IDEs are paid, but have a trial period. Their cost is usually negligible compared to a qualified developer’s salary, so just choose the best one for you.

### Lightweight editors
“Lightweight editors” are not as powerful as IDEs, but they’re fast, elegant and simple.

They are mainly used to open and edit a file instantly.

The main difference between a “lightweight editor” and an “IDE” is that an IDE works on a project-level, so it loads much more data on start, analyzes the project structure if needed and so on. A lightweight editor is much faster if we need only one file.

In practice, lightweight editors may have a lot of plugins including directory-level syntax analyzers and autocompleters, so there’s no strict border between a lightweight editor and an IDE.

There are many options, for instance:

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (cross-platform, shareware).
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows, free).
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are also cool if you know how to use them.

### Let's not argue
The editors in the lists above are those that either I or my friends whom I consider good developers have been using for a long time and are happy with.

There are other great editors in our big world. Please choose the one you like the most.

The choice of an editor, like any other tool, is individual and depends on your projects, habits, and personal preferences.

The author’s personal opinion:

- I’d use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if I develop mostly frontend.
- Otherwise, if it’s mostly another language/platform and partially frontend, then consider other editors, such as XCode (Mac), Visual Studio (Windows) or Jetbrains family (Webstorm, PHPStorm, RubyMine etc, depending on the language).

## 1.4 Developer console
Code is prone to errors. You will quite likely make errors… Oh, what am I talking about? You are _absolutely_ going to make errors, at least if you’re a human, not a [robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)).

But in the browser, users don’t see errors by default. So, if something goes wrong in the script, we won’t see what’s broken and can’t fix it.

To see errors and get a lot of other useful information about scripts, “developer tools” have been embedded in browsers.
> 浏览器内嵌开发者工具

Most developers lean towards Chrome or Firefox for development because those browsers have the best developer tools. Other browsers also provide developer tools, sometimes with special features, but are usually playing “catch-up” to Chrome or Firefox. So most developers have a “favorite” browser and switch to others if a problem is browser-specific.

Developer tools are potent; they have many features. To start, we’ll learn how to open them, look at errors, and run JavaScript commands.

### Google Chrome
Open the page [bug.html](https://javascript.info/article/devtools/bug.html).

There’s an error in the JavaScript code on it. It’s hidden from a regular visitor’s eyes, so let’s open developer tools to see it.

Press F12 or, if you’re on Mac, then Cmd+Opt+J.

The developer tools will open on the Console tab by default.

It looks somewhat like this:

![](https://javascript.info/article/devtools/chrome@2x.png)

The exact look of developer tools depends on your version of Chrome. It changes from time to time but should be similar.

- Here we can see the red-colored error message. In this case, the script contains an unknown “lalala” command.
- On the right, there is a clickable link to the source `bug.html:12` with the line number where the error has occurred.

Below the error message, there is a blue `>` symbol. It marks a “command line” where we can type JavaScript commands. Press Enter to run them.

Now we can see errors, and that’s enough for a start. We’ll come back to developer tools later and cover debugging more in-depth in the chapter [Debugging in the browser](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome).

Multi-line input
Usually, when we put a line of code into the console, and then press Enter, it executes.

To insert multiple lines, press Shift+Enter. This way one can enter long fragments of JavaScript code.

### Firefox, Edge, and others
Most other browsers use F12 to open developer tools.

The look & feel of them is quite similar. Once you know how to use one of these tools (you can start with Chrome), you can easily switch to another.

### Safari
Safari (Mac browser, not supported by Windows/Linux) is a little bit special here. We need to enable the “Develop menu” first.

Open Preferences and go to the “Advanced” pane. There’s a checkbox at the bottom:

![](https://javascript.info/article/devtools/safari@2x.png)

Now Cmd+Opt+C can toggle the console. Also, note that the new top menu item named “Develop” has appeared. It has many commands and options.

### Summary

- Developer tools allow us to see errors, run commands, examine variables, and much more.
- They can be opened with F12 for most browsers on Windows. Chrome for Mac needs Cmd+Opt+J, Safari: Cmd+Opt+C (need to enable first).

Now we have the environment ready. In the next section, we’ll get down to JavaScript.

# 2 JavaScript Fundamentals
## 2.1 Hello, world!
This part of the tutorial is about core JavaScript, the language itself.

But we need a working environment to run our scripts and, since this book is online, the browser is a good choice. We'll keep the amount of browser-specific commands (like `alert`) to a minimum so that you don't spend time on them if you plan to concentrate on another environment (like Node. js). We'll focus on JavaScript in the browser in the [next part](/ui) of the tutorial.

So first, let's see how we attach a script to a webpage. For server-side environments (like Node. js), you can execute the script with a command like `"node my.js"`.

### The "script" tag
JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the `<script>` tag.
> `<script>` 标签用于在 HTML 中插入 JS 脚本

For instance:

```html run height=100
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>

<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' );
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>

</html>
```

You can run the example by clicking the "Play" button in the right-top corner of the box above.

The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed when the browser processes the tag.

### Modern markup
The `<script>` tag has a few attributes that are rarely used nowadays but can still be found in old code:

The `type` attribute: `<script type=... >` : 
The old HTML standard, HTML4, required a script to have a `type`. Usually it was `type="text/javascript"`. It's not required anymore. Also, the modern HTML standard totally changed the meaning of this attribute. Now, it can be used for JavaScript modules. But that's an advanced topic, we'll talk about modules in another part of the tutorial.

The `language` attribute: `<script language=... >` :
This attribute was meant to show the language of the script. This attribute no longer makes sense because JavaScript is the default language. There is no need to use it.

Comments before and after scripts:
In really ancient books and guides, you may find comments inside `<script>` tags, like this:

```html no-beautify
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
    ...
//--></script>
```

This trick isn't used in modern JavaScript. These comments hide JavaScript code from old browsers that didn't know how to process the `<script>` tag. Since browsers released in the last 15 years don't have this issue, this kind of comment can help you identify really old code.

### External scripts
If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.

Script files are attached to HTML with the `src` attribute:
> `src` 属性指定 JS 源文件

```html
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
```

Here, `/path/to/script.js` is an absolute path to the script from the site root. One can also provide a relative path from the current page. For instance, `src="script.js"`, just like `src="./script.js"`, would mean a file `"script.js"` in the current folder.

We can give a full URL as well. For instance:
> `src` 支持 URL

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
```

To attach several scripts, use multiple tags:

```html
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
…
```

Please note:
As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put into HTML. More complex ones reside in separate files.

The benefit of a separate file is that the browser will download it and store it in its [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache).

Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only once.
> 浏览器会下载 JS 源文件，并存储于 cache
> 故其他访问相同 JS 源文件的网页会直接从 cache 取，而不是再从服务端下载

That reduces traffic and makes pages faster.

If ` src ` is set, the script content is ignored.
A single `<script>` tag can't have both the `src` attribute and code inside.

This won't work:

```html
<script *!*src*/!*="file.js">
  alert(1); // the content is ignored, because src is set
</script>
```

We must choose either an external `<script src="…">` or a regular `<script>` with code.

The example above can be split into two scripts to work:

```html
<script src="file.js"></script>
<script>
  alert(1);
</script>
```

### Summary

- We can use a `<script>` tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
- The `type` and `language` attributes are not required.
- A script in an external file can be inserted with `<script src="path/to/script.js"></script>`.

There is much more to learn about browser scripts and their interaction with the webpage. But let's keep in mind that this part of the tutorial is devoted to the JavaScript language, so we shouldn't distract ourselves with browser-specific implementations of it. We'll be using the browser as a way to run JavaScript, which is very convenient for online reading, but only one of many.

## 2.2 Code structure
The first thing we'll study is the building blocks of code.

### Statements
Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.

We've already seen a statement, `alert('Hello, world!')`, which shows the message "Hello, world!".

We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.

For example, here we split "Hello World" into two alerts:

```js run no-beautify
alert('Hello'); alert('World');
```

Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:

```js run no-beautify
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
```

### Semicolons 
A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.
> 如果语句后有换行，JS 允许在语句后面忽略 `;` 

This would also work:

```js run no-beautify
alert('Hello')
alert('World')
```

Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an "implicit" semicolon. This is called an [automatic semicolon insertion](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion).

**In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But "in most cases" does not mean "always"!**

There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:

```js run no-beautify
alert(3 +
1
+ 2);
```

The code outputs `6` because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus `"+"`, then it is an "incomplete expression", so a semicolon there would be incorrect. And in this case, that works as intended.

**But there are situations where JavaScript "fails" to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.**

Errors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.

**An example of an error**
If you're curious to see a concrete example of such an error, check this code out:

```js run
alert("Hello");

[1, 2].forEach(alert);
```

No need to think about the meaning of the brackets `[]` and `forEach` yet. We'll study them later. For now, just remember the result of running the code: it shows `Hello`, then `1`, then `2`.

Now let's remove the semicolon after the `alert`:

```js run no-beautify
alert("Hello")

[1, 2].forEach(alert);
```

The difference compared to the code above is only one character: the semicolon at the end of the first line is gone.

If we run this code, only the first `Hello` shows (and there's an error, you may need to open the console to see it). There are no numbers any more.

That's because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets `[...]`. So, the code in the last example is treated as a single statement.

Here's how the engine sees it:

```js run no-beautify
alert("Hello")[1, 2].forEach(alert);
```

Looks weird, right? Such merging in this case is just wrong. We need to put a semicolon after `alert` for the code to work correctly.

This can happen in other situations also.

We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community. Let's note once again -- *it is possible* to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it's safer -- especially for a beginner -- to use them.

### Comments
As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add *comments* which describe what the code does and why.

Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.

**One-line comments start with two forward slash characters `//`.**
The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.

Like here:

```js run
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');

alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement
```

**Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk <code>/&#42;</code> and end with an asterisk and a forward slash <code>&#42;/</code>.**

Like this:

```js run
/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
```

The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside <code>/&#42; ... &#42;/</code>, it won't execute.

Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:

```js run
/* Commenting out the code
alert('Hello');
*/
alert('World');
```

**Use hotkeys!**
In most editors, a line of code can be commented out by pressing the `key:Ctrl+/` hotkey for a single-line comment and something like `key:Ctrl+Shift+/` -- for multiline comments (select a piece of code and press the hotkey). For Mac, try `key:Cmd` instead of `key:Ctrl` and `key:Option` instead of `key:Shift`.

**Nested comments are not supported!**
There may not be `/*...*/` inside another `/*...*/`.

Such code will die with an error:

```js run no-beautify
/*
  /* nested comment ?!? */
*/
alert( 'World' );
```

Please, don't hesitate to comment your code.

Comments increase the overall code footprint, but that's not a problem at all. There are many tools which minify code before publishing to a production server. They remove comments, so they don't appear in the working scripts. Therefore, comments do not have negative effects on production at all.

Later in the tutorial there will be a chapter code-quality that also explains how to write better comments.

## 2.3 The modern mode, "use strict"
For a long time, JavaScript evolved without compatibility issues. New features were added to the language while old functionality didn't change.

That had the benefit of never breaking existing code. But the downside was that any mistake or an imperfect decision made by JavaScript's creators got stuck in the language forever.

This was the case until 2009 when ECMAScript 5 (ES5) appeared. It added new features to the language and modified some of the existing ones. To keep the old code working, most such modifications are off by default. You need to explicitly enable them with a special directive: `"use strict"`.
> `use strict` 用于启用 ECMAScript 5的新特性，这会导致向后不兼容

### "use strict"
The directive looks like a string: `"use strict"` or `'use strict'`. When it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the "modern" way.

For example:

```js
"use strict";

// this code works the modern way
...
```

Quite soon we're going to learn functions (a way to group commands), so let's note in advance that `"use strict"` can be put at the beginning of a function. Doing that enables strict mode in that function only. But usually people use it for the whole script.

**Ensure that "use strict" is at the top**
Please make sure that `"use strict"` is at the top of your scripts, otherwise strict mode may not be enabled.
> `"use stric"` 需要在脚本顶端

Strict mode isn't enabled here:

```js no-strict
alert("some code");
// "use strict" below is ignored--it must be at the top

"use strict";

// strict mode is not activated
```

Only comments may appear above `"use strict"`.

**There is no way to cancel `use strict`**
There is no directive like `"no use strict"` that reverts the engine to old behavior.

Once we enter strict mode, there's no going back.

### Browser console
When you use a [developer console](info:devtools) to run code, please note that it doesn't `use strict` by default.
> 浏览器的开发者控制台默认不用 `use strict`

Sometimes, when `use strict` makes a difference, you'll get incorrect results.

So, how to actually `use strict` in the console?

First, you can try to press `key:Shift+Enter` to input multiple lines, and put `use strict` on top, like this:

```js
'use strict'; <Shift+Enter for a newline>
//  ...your code
<Enter to run>
```

It works in most browsers, namely Firefox and Chrome.

If it doesn't, e.g. in an old browser, there's an ugly, but reliable way to ensure `use strict`. Put it inside this kind of wrapper:

```js
(function() {
  'use strict';

  // ...your code here...
})()

### Should we "use strict"?
The question may sound obvious, but it's not so.

One could recommend to start scripts with `"use strict"`... But you know what's cool?

Modern JavaScript supports "classes" and "modules" - advanced language structures (we'll surely get to them), that enable `use strict` automatically. So we don't need to add the `"use strict"` directive, if we use them.
> 如果使用了现代 JS 支持的类、模块等结构，引擎会自动添加 `use strict` 指令

**So, for now `"use strict";` is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.**

As of now, we've got to know about `use strict` in general.

In the next chapters, as we learn language features, we'll see the differences between the strict and old modes. Luckily, there aren't many and they actually make our lives better.

All examples in this tutorial assume strict mode unless (very rarely) specified otherwise.

## 2.4 Variables
Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:

1. An online shop -- the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
2. A chat application -- the information might include users, messages, and much more.

Variables are used to store this information.

### A variable
A [variable](https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) is a "named storage" for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let` keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: *declares*) a variable with the name "message":

```js
let message;
```

Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator `=`:

```js
let message;

*!*
message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
*/!*
```

The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:

```js run
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

*!*
alert(message); // shows the variable content
*/!*
```

To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:

```js run
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!
```

We can also declare multiple variables in one line:

```js no-beautify
let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
```

That might seem shorter, but we don't recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.

The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:

```js
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';
```

Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:

```js no-beautify
let user = 'John',
  age = 25,
  message = 'Hello';
```

... Or even in the "comma-first" style:

```js no-beautify
let user = 'John'
  , age = 25
  , message = 'Hello';
```

Technically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it's a matter of personal taste and aesthetics.

````smart header="`var` instead of `let`"
In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: `var` instead of `let`:

```js
*!*var*/!* message = 'Hello';
```

The `var` keyword is *almost* the same as `let`. It also declares a variable but in a slightly different, "old-school" way.

There are subtle differences between `let` and `var`, but they do not matter to us yet. We'll cover them in detail in the chapter <info:var>.
````

## A real-life analogy

We can easily grasp the concept of a "variable" if we imagine it as a "box" for data, with a uniquely-named sticker on it.

For instance, the variable `message` can be imagined as a box labelled `"message"` with the value `"Hello!"` in it:

![](variable.svg)

We can put any value in the box.

We can also change it as many times as we want:

```js run
let message;

message = 'Hello!';

message = 'World!'; // value changed

alert(message);
```

When the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable:

![](variable-change.svg)

We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.

```js run
let hello = 'Hello world!';

let message;

*!*
// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;
*/!*

// now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello); // Hello world!
alert(message); // Hello world!
```

````warn header="Declaring twice triggers an error"
A variable should be declared only once.

A repeated declaration of the same variable is an error:

```js run
let message = "This";

// repeated 'let' leads to an error
let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
```
So, we should declare a variable once and then refer to it without `let`.
````

```smart header="Functional languages"
It's interesting to note that there exist so-called [pure functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming) programming languages, such as [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell), that forbid changing variable values.

In such languages, once the value is stored "in the box", it's there forever. If we need to store something else, the language forces us to create a new box (declare a new variable). We can't reuse the old one.

Though it may seem a little odd at first sight, these languages are quite capable of serious development. More than that, there are areas like parallel computations where this limitation confers certain benefits.
```

## Variable naming [#variable-naming]

There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

1. The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols `$` and `_`.
2. The first character must not be a digit.

Examples of valid names:

```js
let userName;
let test123;
```

When the name contains multiple words, [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: `myVeryLongName`.

What's interesting -- the dollar sign `'$'` and the underscore `'_'` can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters, without any special meaning.

These names are valid:

```js run untrusted
let $ = 1; // declared a variable with the name "$"
let _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name "_"

alert($ + _); // 3
```

Examples of incorrect variable names:

```js no-beautify
let 1a; // cannot start with a digit

let my-name; // hyphens '-' aren't allowed in the name
```

```smart header="Case matters"
Variables named `apple` and `APPLE` are two different variables.
```

````smart header="Non-Latin letters are allowed, but not recommended"
It is possible to use any language, including Cyrillic letters, Chinese logograms and so on, like this:

```js
let имя = '...';
let 我 = '...';
```

Technically, there is no error here. Such names are allowed, but there is an international convention to use English in variable names. Even if we're writing a small script, it may have a long life ahead. People from other countries may need to read it sometime.
````

````warn header="Reserved names"
There is a [list of reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords), which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.

For example: `let`, `class`, `return`, and `function` are reserved.

The code below gives a syntax error:

```js run no-beautify
let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!
let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!
```
````

````warn header="An assignment without `use strict`"

Normally, we need to define a variable before using it. But in the old times, it was technically possible to create a variable by a mere assignment of the value without using `let`. This still works now if we don't put `use strict` in our scripts to maintain compatibility with old scripts.

```js run no-strict
// note: no "use strict" in this example

num = 5; // the variable "num" is created if it didn't exist

alert(num); // 5
```

This is a bad practice and would cause an error in strict mode:

```js
"use strict";

*!*
num = 5; // error: num is not defined
*/!*
```
````

## Constants

To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use `const` instead of `let`:

```js
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';
```

Variables declared using `const` are called "constants". They cannot be reassigned. An attempt to do so would cause an error:

```js run
const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';

myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
```

When a programmer is sure that a variable will never change, they can declare it with `const` to guarantee and communicate that fact to everyone.

### Uppercase constants

There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known before execution.

Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.

For instance, let's make constants for colors in so-called "web" (hexadecimal) format:

```js run
const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); // #FF7F00
```

Benefits:

- `COLOR_ORANGE` is much easier to remember than `"#FF7F00"`.
- It is much easier to mistype `"#FF7F00"` than `COLOR_ORANGE`.
- When reading the code, `COLOR_ORANGE` is much more meaningful than `#FF7F00`.

When should we use capitals for a constant and when should we name it normally? Let's make that clear.

Being a "constant" just means that a variable's value never changes. But some constants are known before execution (like a hexadecimal value for red) and some constants are *calculated* in run-time, during the execution, but do not change after their initial assignment.

For instance:

```js
const pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */;
```

The value of `pageLoadTime` is not known before the page load, so it's named normally. But it's still a constant because it doesn't change after the assignment.

In other words, capital-named constants are only used as aliases for "hard-coded" values.

## Name things right

Talking about variables, there's one more extremely important thing.

A variable name should have a clean, obvious meaning, describing the data that it stores.

Variable naming is one of the most important and complex skills in programming. A glance at variable names can reveal which code was written by a beginner versus an experienced developer.

In a real project, most of the time is spent modifying and extending an existing code base rather than writing something completely separate from scratch. When we return to some code after doing something else for a while, it's much easier to find information that is well-labelled. Or, in other words, when the variables have good names.

Please spend time thinking about the right name for a variable before declaring it. Doing so will repay you handsomely.

Some good-to-follow rules are:

- Use human-readable names like `userName` or `shoppingCart`.
- Stay away from abbreviations or short names like `a`, `b`, and `c`, unless you know what you're doing.
- Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are `data` and `value`. Such names say nothing. It's only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing.
- Agree on terms within your team and in your mind. If a site visitor is called a "user" then we should name related variables `currentUser` or `newUser` instead of `currentVisitor` or `newManInTown`.

Sounds simple? Indeed it is, but creating descriptive and concise variable names in practice is not. Go for it.

```smart header="Reuse or create?"
And the last note. There are some lazy programmers who, instead of declaring new variables, tend to reuse existing ones.

As a result, their variables are like boxes into which people throw different things without changing their stickers. What's inside the box now? Who knows? We need to come closer and check.

Such programmers save a little bit on variable declaration but lose ten times more on debugging.

An extra variable is good, not evil.

Modern JavaScript minifiers and browsers optimize code well enough, so it won't create performance issues. Using different variables for different values can even help the engine optimize your code.
```

## Summary

We can declare variables to store data by using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

- `let` -- is a modern variable declaration.
- `var` -- is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don't use it at all, but we'll cover subtle differences from `let` in the chapter <info:var>, just in case you need them.
- `const` -- is like `let`, but the value of the variable can't be changed.

Variables should be named in a way that allows us to easily understand what's inside them.
