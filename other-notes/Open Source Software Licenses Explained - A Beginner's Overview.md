[Open Source Software Licenses Explained: A Beginner's Overview](https://osssoftware.org/blog/open-source-software-licenses-explained-a-beginners-overview/)
# 1 Introduction to Open Source Software Licenses
Unlike proprietary software that places restrictions on usage and distribution, open source software guarantees end users the freedom to use, modify, and share the software.

Open source lisences allow software to remain open while providing legal protections against misuse.
# 2 Understanding Open Source Software and its Philosophy
Key aspects of open source software include:
- Free redistribution - anyone can use, modify and distribute the software
- Accessible source code - the code is public and easily viewed
- Continuous improvements - enabled by community collaboration
Open source licenses aim to protect these ideals.
# 3 The Role of Licenses in Open Source Projects
Open source licenses set the terms ( 条款 ) under which the software can be used, modified and redistributed. This serves multiple purposes:
- Allows commercial use of open source software ( 允许商业使用 )
- Protects open source code from proprietary forks ( 保护源代码受专有分支影响 )
- Requires user improvements to be open sourced ( 要求用户进一步开发开源 )
- Credits the original creators
- Allows monetization through dual licensing ( 在双协议下允许商业用途 )
# 3 Preview of the Types of Open Source Licenses
There are two main categories of open source licenses:

**Permissive** ( 宽松型 )- minimal restrictions on usage and distribution ( 对源代码的使用和发布仅有最小的限制 )

**Copyleft** ( 版权左型 )- requires user improvements to the code be open sourced ( 要求用户的进一步开发开源 )

Common permissive licenses include MIT, Apache 2.0 and BSD. The GPL license is the most popular copyleft license.

Later sections explore these licenses and their subtleties in more depth.
# 4 How does Open-Source Software Licensing Work?
Open source licenses allow the free use, modification, and distribution of software. For a license to be approved as open source by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), it must comply with the Open Source Definition ( 开源定义 ) and complete the OSI's license review ( 审查 ) process.

Here are some key things to know about open-source licensing:
- **Permissions**: ( 权限 ) Open source licenses grant permissions to use, modify, and share the software freely. Some licenses have conditions like requiring modified versions to remain open source.
- **Copyright**: ( 版权 ) The software code is still protected by copyright law. The copyright holder, often the original authors, provides permissions through the license.
- **License compatibility**: ( 许可证兼容性 ) Some open source licenses are compatible for combining code but others have restrictions. ( 一些许可证允许将代码与其他许可证下的代码结合使用 ) For example, GPL-licensed code cannot be integrated with proprietary closed-source code. ( GPL 许可证下的代码不允许与专有闭源代码集成 )
- **Types of licenses**: Common open source licenses like MIT, BSD, Apache, and GPL have important differences in distributing derivative works, using patents, and commercialization. Picking the right license is important.
# 5 What are the Four Major Types of Open Source Licenses?
Open source licenses broadly fall under two categories - permissive and copyleft. Let's explore the four most popular OSS licenses:
## 5.1 Permissive Licenses
These licenses allow users to modify and reuse open source code without requiring derivative works to be open sourced. ( 允许用户修改和复用代码，且衍生工作不需要开源 )

Some examples include:
- **MIT License:** A short, permissive license that allows reuse of code in proprietary software without requiring source disclosure. Used by projects like React, Rails, NumPy.
- **Apache License 2.0:** Similar to MIT but with an express patent license grant. ( 包含了一个专利授权条款，保护用户免受专利诉讼的威胁 ) Used in Android, Apache, Swift.
## 5.2 Copyleft Licenses
These licenses require derivative works to be released under the same open source license. Source code availability is mandatory. ( 要求衍生工作在相同许可证下发布 )

Examples include:
- **GNU GPL:** Requires source code availability for derivative works. ( 要求衍生作品必须提供源代码 ) Used in Linux, Git, WordPress. Has reciprocity requirements. ( 互惠性要求 )
- **GNU LGPL:** A "lesser" GPL version for linking libraries. Source disclosure not needed for works using the library. ( 对于使用 LGPL 库的程序，不需要披露程序本身的源代码，但修改后的库需要以 LGPL 许可证发布 ) Used in Mozilla, GIMP.

Choosing an open source license depends on the project objectives and community preferences. Permissive licenses encourage more usage while copyleft licenses ensure [ongoing open source contributions](https://osssoftware.org/blog/open-source-software-contribution-a-starters-roadmap/).
# 6 What is the Difference Between Open-Source Software and Software License?
# 7 What are the 5 Different Types of Software Licenses?
There are 5 main categories of software licenses:
1. **Public Domain License**( 公共领域许可证 ) - This is the most permissive license where copyright is waived entirely ( 版权被完全放弃 ). Software under public domain can be used, modified, and distributed without any restrictions. ( 没有任何限制 )
2. **Permissive License**( 宽松型许可证 ) - These licenses allow software to be used, modified, and distributed freely. However, they require modified versions to retain original copyright/license when redistributed. ( 要求修改后的版本在分发的时候保持原来的版权/许可证 ) Examples are MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD.
3. **Copyleft License**( 版权左型许可证 ) - Also known as "share-alike ( 以相同方式共享 )" license. It requires modified versions to use the same copyleft license terms as the original work. This helps software remain free and open source. Popular copyleft licenses are GPL, LGPL.
4. **Proprietary License**( 专有许可证 ) - This restricts users from accessing, modifying or redistributing the software. ( 限制了用户对软件的访问、修改、重发布 ) Proprietary software is owned by an individual or company with exclusive copyright. Users must agree to certain terms of use.
5. **Custom License**( 自定义许可证 ) - Some software uses custom or project-specific licenses with customized terms for usage, modification and redistribution. These are tailored to the specific needs of the project.

Choosing an appropriate open source license involves understanding tradeoffs around commercial use, derivative works, patent protection, compatibility with other licenses, etc. Permissive and copyleft licenses are most popular for open source distribution
# 8 Permissive Open Source Licenses
Permissive open source licenses place minimal restrictions on how software can be used, modified, and distributed. This gives developers broad freedoms when working with permissively licensed code.
## 8.1 Defining Permissive Open Source Licenses
Permissive open source licenses differ from copyleft licenses in that they do not require derivative works to adopt the same licensing terms. This means you can modify and integrate permissively licensed code into proprietary software without needing to open source that code. Common permissive licenses include MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, and zlib licenses.

Some key aspects of permissive licensing:
- Allows use of code in proprietary software
- Does not require sharing source code of derivative works
- Compatible for combining with other open source licenses
- Gives up protections compared to copyleft licensing

So while permissive licensing provides flexibility, it also relinquishes some control over how others might use the code down the road.
## 8.2 Common Permissive Licenses: MIT, Apache, and More
Some of the most popular permissive open source licenses include:
**MIT License** - Extremely simple and permissive. Allows reuse in proprietary software provided the license is included.
**Apache 2.0 License** - Permissive but includes express patent license from contributors. Maintained by Apache Foundation.
**BSD 3-Clause License** - Permissive license with attribution required. Used by projects like TensorFlow and OpenBSD.
**zlib License** - Permissive license focused on software libraries. Used in key infrastructural libraries.

While the details vary, these licenses generally allow broad freedoms for reusing and modifying code with few restrictions. This flexibility makes them a popular choice, especially for libraries and frameworks designed for integration.
# 9 Copyleft Licenses
Copyleft licenses require derivative works built from copyleft-licensed code to adopt the same open source license. This ensures the open source nature of projects is preserved as code is reused and modified.
## 9.1 The Essence of Copyleft in Open Source
Copyleft provisions require modified versions or derivative works of copyleft-licensed code to use the same license. This differs from permissive licenses, which allow derivative projects to adopt any license, including proprietary closed-source licenses.

Some key points about copyleft:
- It preserves open source licensing as code is reused. Without copyleft, modified works could become closed source.
- The goal is preventing open source code being made proprietary through modification and distribution.
- It encourages collaboration since all improvements must be released as open source.
## 9.2 Profiles of Common Copyleft Licenses
Some well-known copyleft licenses:
**GNU GPL** - The most popular FOSS license. Used by Linux, Bash, Vim, and more. Requires source code access and copyleft reuse.
**GNU LGPL** - A more permissive library variant of GPL. Allows linking to proprietary code. Used in Git, OpenSSL, Qt.
**Affero GPL (AGPL)** - An enhanced GPL variant that copylefts network service source code. Used by MongoDB, Odoo.

These provide a spectrum of copyleft conditions to choose from for open source projects. The differences center around code linking, network services, and license compatibility issues.
# 10 Conclusion: Recap and Essential Points
## 10.1 Summary of Open Source License Categories
Open source licenses can be broadly divided into two categories:
- **Permissive licenses** - These allow users to modify and redistribute the software without requiring changes to be open sourced. Examples include MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD. They place minimal restrictions on usage.
- **Copyleft licenses** - These require modified versions to stay open source. Examples include GPL, LGPL, AGPL. They ensure ongoing open access but can limit commercial usage.

Choosing between them depends on the project's priorities and community values around sharing vs commercialization.
## 10.2 Critical Considerations When Choosing an Open Source License
When selecting an open source license, key aspects to evaluate include:
- **Compatibility** - Will the license allow integration with other open source or proprietary software?
- **Commercial usage** - Does the license permit selling the software or SaaS services based on it?
- **Liability limitations** - Does it limit legal risks for contributors and redistributors?
- **Community norms** - What license does the language/framework ecosystem commonly use?

Understanding these elements ensures the license aligns with the project's technical and business needs.
## 10.3 Final Thoughts on Adhering to Open Source License Terms
Using open source code requires carefully studying the associated license terms. Key best practices:
- Maintain licenses and copyright notices with code distributions
- Track licenses and compliance responsibility for dependencies
- Seek legal counsel if unsure of rights or usage scenarios

Following license conditions is crucial for avoiding disputes. They enable collaborative innovation.
