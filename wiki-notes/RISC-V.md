**RISC-V** (pronounced "risk-five")  is a free and open-source [instruction set architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture "Instruction set architecture") (ISA) based on [reduced instruction set computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer "Reduced instruction set computer") (RISC) principles. Unlike proprietary ISAs such as [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86 "X86") and [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture "ARM architecture"), RISC-V is described as "[free and open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_hardware "Free and open-source hardware")" because its specifications are released under permissive open-source licenses and can be implemented without paying royalties. [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-8)
>  RISC-V 是一个基于精简指令集原则的开源指令集架构 (ISA)
>  x86 和 ARM 则是专有指令集架构
>  RISC-V 的规格文档是在开源协议下发布的，可以无需支付专利费进行实现

RISC-V was developed in 2010 at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley") as the fifth generation of RISC processors created at the university since 1981. [6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-9) In 2015, development and maintenance of the standard was transferred to **RISC-V International**, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland with more than 4,500 members as of 2025. [7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-10)
>  RISC-V 在 2010 年由 UCB 开发，作为该大学开发的第五代 RISC 处理器
>  2015 年，RISC-V 标准的的维护和开发工作转交给 RISC-V International 组织

RISC-V is a popular architecture for [microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller "Microcontroller") and embedded systems, with development of higher-performance implementations targeting mobile, desktop, and server markets ongoing. The ISA is supported by several major [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution"), and companies such as [SiFive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiFive "SiFive"), [Andes Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes_Technology "Andes Technology"), [SpacemiT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpacemiT "SpacemiT"), [Synopsys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synopsys "Synopsys"), [Alibaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group#Cloud_computing_and_artificial_intelligence_technology "Alibaba Group") (DAMO Academy), and [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi "Raspberry Pi") offer commercial [systems on a chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip "System on a chip") (SoCs) that incorporate one or more RISC-V compatible CPU cores. [8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-:5-11)
>  RISC-V 广泛用于为控制器和嵌入式系统，针对移动端、桌面、服务器市场的实现仍在开发中
>  目前多个主流 Linux 发行版都支持 RISC-V ISA，一些公司也提供了商用的片上系统 (SoC)，这些 SoC 集成了一个或者多个兼容 RISC-V 的 CPU 核心

## History
The term _[RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer "Reduced instruction set computer")_ dates from about 1980. [9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-riscstart-12) Before then, there was some knowledge (see [John Cocke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cocke_\(computer_scientist\) "John Cocke (computer scientist)")) that simpler computers can be effective, but the design principles were not widely described. Simple, effective computers have always been of academic interest, and resulted in the RISC instruction set [DLX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLX "DLX") for the first edition of _Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach_ in 1990 of which [David Patterson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Patterson_\(computer_scientist\) "David Patterson (computer scientist)") was a co-author, and he later participated in the RISC-V origination. DLX was intended for educational use; academics and hobbyists implemented it using [field-programmable gate arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array "Field-programmable gate array") (FPGA), but it was never truly intended for commercial deployment.
>  最早的 RISC 指令集为 DLX，DLX 主要用于教学，学者和爱好者使用 FPGA 实现了它，但从未用于商业部署

[Krste Asanović](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krste_Asanovi%C4%87 "Krste Asanović") at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"), had a research requirement for an open-source CPU core, and in 2010, he decided to develop and publish his own, in a "short, three-month project over the summer" with several of his graduate students. Several established open-source alternatives were available, but Asanović chose not to use them. [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture "ARM architecture") and [SuperH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperH "SuperH") CPUs (versions 2 and earlier) had public-domain instruction sets with [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL "VHDL") implementation files, [10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-13) [11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-amber-14) [12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-arm4u-15) while complete [OpenRISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenRISC "OpenRISC"), [OpenPOWER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenPOWER "OpenPOWER"), and [OpenSPARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSPARC "OpenSPARC") / [LEON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEON "LEON") cores were also available either as [VHDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL "VHDL") files or from various vendors. All of these existing options were supported by the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection "GNU Compiler Collection") (GCC), a popular [free-software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software "Free software") compiler, and had [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux") kernel support. [13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-16) [14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-17) [15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-18) The plan was to aid both academic and industrial users. [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-isasbfree-19) David Patterson at Berkeley joined the collaboration as he was the originator of the Berkeley RISC, [9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-riscstart-12) and the RISC-V is the eponymous fifth generation of his long series of cooperative RISC-based research projects at the University of California, Berkeley ([RISC-I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_RISC#RISC_I "Berkeley RISC") and [RISC-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_RISC#RISC_II "Berkeley RISC") published in 1981 by Patterson, who refers [17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-genealogy-20) to the SOAR architecture [18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-21) from 1984 as "RISC-III" and the SPUR architecture [19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-22) from 1988 as "RISC-IV"). At this stage, students provided initial software, simulations, and CPU designs. [20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-contributors-23)

The RISC-V authors and their institution originally sourced the ISA documents [21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-originalisa-24) and several CPU designs under [BSD licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses "BSD licenses"), which allow derivative works—such as RISC-V chip designs—to be either open and free, or closed and proprietary. The ISA specification itself (i.e., the encoding of the instruction set) was published in 2011 as open source, [22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-25) with all rights reserved. The actual technical report (an expression of the specification) was later placed under a [Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license "Creative Commons license") to permit enhancement by external contributors through the RISC-V Foundation, and later RISC-V International.
>  RISC-V ISA 规范本身 (指令集的编码形式) 在 2011 年开源发布

A full history of RISC-V has been published on the RISC-V International website. [23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-history-26)

### Foundations
Commercial users require an ISA to be stable before they can use it in a product that may last many years. To address this issue, the RISC-V Foundation was formed in 2015 to own, maintain, and publish intellectual property related to RISC-V's definition. [24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-27) The original authors and owners have surrendered their rights to the foundation. The foundation is led by CEO [Calista Redmond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calista_Redmond "Calista Redmond"), who took on the role in 2019 after leading open infrastructure projects at [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM"). [25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-28)

The founding members of RISC-V were: [Andes Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes_Technology "Andes Technology"), Antmicro, [Bluespec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluespec "Bluespec"), [Ceva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceva_\(semiconductor_company\) "Ceva (semiconductor company)"), [Codasip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codasip "Codasip"), Cortus, Esperanto Technologies, [Espressif Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espressif_Systems "Espressif Systems"), [ETH Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETH_Zurich "ETH Zurich"), Google, IBM, ICT, [IIT Madras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras "IIT Madras"), [Lattice Semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_Semiconductor "Lattice Semiconductor"), [LowRISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LowRISC "LowRISC"), [Microchip Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchip_Technology "Microchip Technology"), the [MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory "MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory"), [Qualcomm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm "Qualcomm"), [Rambus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambus "Rambus"), Rumble Development, [SiFive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiFive "SiFive"), Syntacore and Technolution. [26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-29)

In November 2019, the RISC-V Foundation announced that it would relocate to Switzerland, citing concerns over U.S. trade regulations. [27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-30) [28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-31) As of March 2020, the organization was named RISC-V International, a Swiss nonprofit business association. [29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-32)

As of 2019, RISC-V International freely publishes the documents defining RISC-V and permits unrestricted use of the ISA for design of software and hardware. However, only members of RISC-V International can vote to approve changes, and only member organizations use the [trademarked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark "Trademark") compatibility logo. [30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-33)
>  RISC-V International 免费发布定义 RISC-V 的文档，并允许在设计软件和硬件时，对该 ISA 进行无限制使用

The Linux Foundation Europe started the RISC-V Software Ecosystem (RISE) initiative on May 31, 2023. The goal of RISE is to increase the availability of software for high-performance and power-efficient RISC-V processors running high-level operating systems for a range of market segments by bringing together a large number of hardware and software vendors. [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat "Red Hat"), [Samsung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung "Samsung"), Qualcomm, [Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia "Nvidia"), [MediaTek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek "MediaTek"), Intel, and Google are among the initial members.

RISC-V processor prototype, January 2013

[CPU design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_design "CPU design") requires design expertise in several specialties: electronic [digital logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate"), [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler "Compiler"), and [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). To cover the costs of such a team, commercial vendors of processor intellectual property (IP), such as [Arm Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Ltd. "Arm Ltd.") and [MIPS Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_Technologies "MIPS Technologies"), charge [royalties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment "Royalty payment") for the use of their designs and [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent"). [33](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-36) [34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-37) [35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-38) They also often require [non-disclosure agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement "Non-disclosure agreement") before releasing documents that describe their designs' detailed advantages. In many cases, they never describe the reasons for their design choices.
>  CPU 设计通常需要多个领域的知识: 电子数字逻辑、编译器、OS
>  具有处理器知识产权的供应商，例如 ARM, MIPS 通常会对其设计和专利的使用收取版税，并且还通常要求签署保密协议才能发布描述其设计优势的详细文档
>  在许多情况下，它们甚至从不解释设计选择的原因

RISC-V was begun with a goal to make a practical ISA that was open-sourced, usable academically, and deployable in any hardware or software design without royalties.  Also, justifying rationales for each design decision of the project are explained, at least in broad terms. The RISC-V authors are academics who have substantial experience in computer design, and the RISC-V ISA is a direct development from a series of academic computer-design projects, especially [Berkeley RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_RISC "Berkeley RISC"). RISC-V was originated in part to aid all such projects. 
>  RISC-V 的目标是提供一个开源，免费使用的 ISA，并且会至少在总体上解释其中的每一个设计决策

To build a large, continuing community of users and thereby accumulate designs and software, the RISC-V ISA designers intentionally support a wide variety of practical use cases: compact, performance, and low-power real-world implementations  without over-architecting for a given [microarchitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture "Microarchitecture"). The requirements of a large base of contributors is part of the reason why RISC-V was engineered to address many possible uses.
>  RISC-V ISA 的设计者有意支持各种实际应用场景: 紧凑型、性能型、低功耗型，并且避免为特定的微架构过度设计

The designers' primary assertion is that the instruction set is the key interface in a computer as it is situated at the interface between the hardware and the software. If a good instruction set were open and available for use by all, then it can dramatically reduce the cost of software by enabling far more reuse. It should also trigger increased competition among hardware providers, who can then devote more resources toward design and less for software support. [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-isasbfree-19)
>  设计者的首要观点是: 指令集是计算机中最重要的接口，因为它位于硬件和软件的交接处
>  如果有一个优秀的开放指令集，它就可以通过实现更广泛的重用来大幅降低软件成本，也可以促使硬件供应商之间展开更激烈的竞争，让他们将资源投入到设计中，而不是软件支持上

The designers maintain that new principles are becoming rare in instruction set design, as the most successful designs of the last forty years have grown increasingly similar. Of those that failed, most did so because their sponsoring companies were financially unsuccessful, not because the instruction sets were technically poor. Thus, a well-designed open instruction set designed using well-established principles should attract long-term support by many vendors. [16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-isasbfree-19)
>  设计者认为，指令设计中的新原则已经越来越少，因为过去 40 年最成功的指令集设计已经变得越来越相似
>  因此，一个基于成熟原则设计的开放指令集能够吸引众多厂商的长期支持

RISC-V also encourages academic usage. The simplicity of the integer subset permits basic student exercises, and is a simple enough ISA to enable software to control research machines. The variable-length ISA provides room for instruction set extensions for both student exercises and research,   and the separated [privileged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_\(computing\) "Privilege (computing)") instruction set permits research in operating system support without redesigning compilers. [40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-priv-isa-43) RISC-V's open intellectual property paradigm allows derivative designs to be published, reused, and modified. [41](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V#cite_note-isa2.1-44)
>  RISC-V 的核心指令集 (整数子集) 的设计非常简洁，易于理解和使用，也足以作为研究机器 (例如 FPGA 实现的处理器) 的 ISA
>  RISC-V 的指令长度不是固定的，也就是支持基于 RISC-V 进行自定义指令集拓展
>  RISC-V 将用户模式指令和特权模式指令进行了分离
