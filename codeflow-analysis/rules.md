(1) Use `(<number>)` to describe the code logic topic by topic in sequence.

(2) The format to declare objects is like 
- `(<number>) <function-name> function`
- `(<number>) <class-name> class`

(3) When describing functions, classes, if possible, use imperative sentence. For example: (The function) do something.

(4) The basic form of the opening and closing nesting indicator is `|+>` and `<|+`, where `|+` means one or more `|` character. The number of `|` characters should increase with the nesting depth.
